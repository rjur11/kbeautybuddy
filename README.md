## Abstract

Whether you're a skincare noob or retinol lover, this application is here to provide you with your next Korean skincare routine! Why Korean skincare (or k-beauty), specifically? K-beauty focuses on prevention and healing, and skincare routines are individualized to a persons' skin type and skin concerns. Having such personalized routines ensures effective care to the skin. This application will guide a user through a quiz to determine their skin type and top skin concern, and will create a personalized routine of 2-, 3-, or 5- products for them at the end. If they're not happy with the routine provided, they can take the quiz again, or head to the catalog page and learn more about all of the available products. If they find something they prefer, they can swap that product into their routine instead.
